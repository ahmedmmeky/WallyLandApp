3) Package:Controller Classes: LoginController.java,RegistrationController.java.,ParkApp.java
4) View Package:View  NavigationUI.java,  LoginPage.java, NavigationUI.java,and RegistrationUI.java

5) Second Use Case:
   This Use Case was meant to create a Login Page and Registration Page for vistors of WallyLand.
   These pages are meant to be the first and second screens users see before navigating to the 
   home page and from the home page be directed to rest of the application. On this Use Case I create a 
   database using a JSON file, to store, read and write the users information during the SignUP/LoginIn process.
   Currently the screen utilizes the JSON file to authenticate and verify the users identity when login in. If their 
   identification is correct is gives them a message "Password Matched" and if its incorrect it says "Wrong Email/Password".
